## Overview
SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other secure network services between two networked computers. It is widely used for managing remote systems and accessing remote servers securely over an unsecured network.

## Key Features
- **Secure Communication**: SSH provides a secure channel over an insecure network by encrypting all traffic, including user authentication and commands.
- **Remote Access**: Allows users to access and manage remote systems securely.
- **Public Key Authentication**: Supports public key authentication, which provides a more secure and convenient way to authenticate users.
- **Port Forwarding**: Allows tunneling of arbitrary TCP connections over the encrypted SSH channel.
- **SFTP**: SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) allows secure file transfer and manipulation over a secure data stream.

## Components
- **SSH Client**: The client component used to initiate SSH connections to remote servers.
- **SSH Server**: The server component that listens for incoming SSH connections and handles authentication and remote command execution.

## Usage
1. **Connecting to a Remote Server**: Use the SSH client to connect to a remote server:
2. **Public Key Authentication**: Use public key authentication for more secure and passwordless login:
3. **File Transfer (SFTP)**: Use SFTP for secure file transfer:
